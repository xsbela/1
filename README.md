## Basic CV design

This was an activity for my **Ultima** course where we needed to make a basic curriculum using only HTML and images

### Goals:

* Use a photo with the .png extension for your photo;
* Resize the size using the width and height properties;
* Create a split div for each type of content;
* Create ul list, p paragraphs or table tables to display texts;
* Explore other font formats and arrangement of elements on the screen;
* Pay attention to the organization of the code and correct use of tags.
